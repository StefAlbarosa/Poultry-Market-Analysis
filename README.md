Global Market Analysis for Poultry production 
This project was conducted as part of my OpenClassroom Data Analysis bootcamp. I analysed the diet, import and population growth of all countries using FAO data to find target countries for a poultry companies expansion.  
It is made in Python in a Jupyter notebook.
There are two two files attached, one for cleaning and the other one for the analysis of the data.
DATA CLEANING: I replaced null values and searched for other inconsistencies. I created new columns of growth rates and added a new data frame that includes KFC stores globally. 
Instructions:
1.	Open folder: Cleaning.ipynb
2.	Run all cells.
DATA ANALYSIS The analysis was based on the consumption of meat, poultry and their import as well as the number of kfc stores per country (as another indicator for a growing poultry industry). Conducted a PCA to reduce number of columns, a Kmeans analysis and also a Hierarchical clustering. The results of Kmeans and Hierarchical clustering were compared, for each the cluster with the highest scores of poultry consumption and kfc stores were selected. The cluster with these values had the same 10 elements for each clustering methods so I chose those countries as the potential markets to expand to.
